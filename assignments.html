                    <img src="assets/project1.svg" alt="">
                    <p>Choose a regular activity or environment in your daily life that you want to observe. This could be your morning routine, the sounds in your neighborhood, the patterns of people in a public space, or the variations in your own habits. We will record these behaviors as quantitative or qualitative data, and later design a poster that shows your collected data by using symbols, typography, colour/texture, and hierarchy. Your visual design should reflect the visual material that you gather.</p>
                    <p id="project1-1"><strong>Week 1: Data Collection</strong></p>
                    <p>This week is about observation. We will learn about qualitative and quantitative data and how to record them based on your chosen activity or environment. Over the course of your one-week observation, you will need to collect a dataset that includes at least 20 records. Each record should have at least 10 data points. A data point can be quantitative, such as time durations, frequencies, or counts, or qualitative, such as colors you observe, emotions you experience, or changes in the environment. Document your observations with photographs or sketches, and enter your collected data into a Google Sheet (you can refer to <a href="https://www.thesquirrelcensus.com/data" target="_blank">The Squirrel Census</a>'s <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/7hf5i33slsr5z44c3eues/park-data.csv?rlkey=qfk9bitznqjhxemrqoyrtcdje&e=1&dl=0" target="_blank">park data</a> and <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/is2yaa5gz1of32xo1xwvd/squirrel-data.csv?rlkey=sao5wj2tqd98nzs6rsi5k7ot6&e=1&dl=0" target="_blank">squirrel data</a> as examples). You will share this research and documentation in class next week.</p>
                    <p id="project1-2"><strong>Week 2: Clustering, Grouping, Sorting</strong></p>
                    <p>Organize your findings by sorting, grouping similar elements together and identifying relationships between them, e.g. screen time of each day of a week, bus stop counts of each neighborhood. How do the patterns change? What new trends emerge? What stays consistent, what varies, or what stands out? Come up with 1 - 3 ideas for your digital poster. (Sketching for your ideas is encouraged but optional)</p>
                    <p id="project1-3"><strong>Week 3: Mapping and Visualizing</strong></p>
                    <p>Design a poster or sketch that shows your collected data. Use symbols, typography, colour/texture, and hierarchy to note the key data points of your findings and information. Your visual design should relate to the visual material that you gather.</p>

                    <img src="assets/project2.svg" alt="">
                    <p>Pick one dataset or more datasets you are interested in visualizing or curious about. We will learn to do data cleaning to better analyze and understand it. Take this data and make one or multiple graph(s), diagrams, or visualizations that show your findings or insights. What graphs most accurately represent your chosen dataset? What charts clearly communicate the findings, insights, or stories?</p>
                    <p id="project2-1"><strong>Week 5: Datasets and Data Processing</strong></p>
                    <p>The last assignment focused on collecting and visualizing our own data, but a lot of times you need to work with other peopleâ€™s datasets which often contain large volumes of data points requiring precise and accurate visualization. For this project, we learn to deal with and design for large-scale data, particularly by leveraging computer-aided design tools. Find a dataset you are interested in sites like <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wZhPLMCHKJvwOkP4juclhjFgqIY8fQFMemwKL2c64vk/edit?gid=0#gid=0" target="_blank">Data is Plural Structured Archive</a>(by Alvin Chang), <a href="https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/" target="_blank">Data is Plural</a>, <a href="https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/data/" target="_blank">NYC Open Data</a>, <a href="https://informationisbeautiful.net/data/" target="_blank">Information is Beautiful</a>, <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets" target="_blank">Kaggle</a>, <a href="https://www.spotify.com/us/account/privacy/?flow_ctx=b0759e4b-56ba-4143-9cb3-fc61e0a7ebe8%3A1723159053" target="_blank">Spotify</a> etc. Explore and process it using methods we have learned (including the ones in Project 1) by asking 1 - 3 questions you want to find out or visualize in this project.</p>
                    <p id="project2-2"><strong>Week 6: Common Charts</strong></p>
                    <p>Now we have processed and cleaned our data, and we want to make it easy to read, or even tell a story by visualizing it with graphs and charts. What makes a chart accessible? What are some common charts that can present data and insights to your audience in a compelling way? Create 1 - 3 charts for your data using <a href="https://flourish.studio/" target="_blank">Floursih</a> or other computer-aid design tools. See which graphs convey your ideas best and if any new insights appear during the process.</p>
                    <p id="project2-3"><strong>Week 8: Data Stories</strong></p>
                    <p>After visualizing the dataset, we evaluate whether our visualizations convey the insights, trends, or patterns within the data. Does your audience clearly understand the information? Do they grasp the story you intend to tell? Beyond ensuring that your charts are accessible, we also aim to transform data into data stories. After gathering feedback from your audience, refine your chart to better highlight the key message behind your data. The final format can be an infographic poster, presentation slides, a data journalism piece, or an interactive prototype.</p>

                    <h3>Project 3: <br> Interactive Information</h3>
                    <img src="assets/project3.svg" alt="">
                    <p>In this assignment, we will create our own personal dataset and create an interactive visualization by leveraging computational methods. We will learn how to use p5.js to visualize data in code, and think about how the map function can help us invent our own charts: such as playing with color intensities, shape sizes reflecting quantities, mouse interaction, or animated transitions. Through hands-on coding experience, we will critically think about questions like: What are the limitations of using data viz softwares? Why do designers code? What's the benefit of coding our own chart?</p>
                    <!-- <p><strong>Week 1: Data Collection</strong></p>
                    <p>This week is about observation. We learn about qualitative and quantitative data and how to record them based on your chosen environment. Over the course of your one week observation, you will need to collect at least two datasets. One quantitative: for example, time durations, frequencies, or counts. One qualitative: colors you observe, emotions you experience, or changes in environment. Each dataset should have at least 10 data points. Document your observations with photographs or sketches, and enter your collected data on a google sheet. You will share this research and documentation in class next week.</p>
                    <p><strong>Week 2: Clustering, Grouping, Categorizing</strong></p>
                    <p>Next: select a different scale of the same type of activity or environment. If you tracked your morning routine, look at your entire day. If you observe your neighborhood, expand to your entire borough. Gather 10 more pieces of data about this larger scope. Organize your findings by grouping similar elements together and identifying relationships between them, e.g. screen time each day of a week, bus stop counts of each neighborhood. How do patterns change? What new variables emerge? What stays consistent and what varies?</p> -->
