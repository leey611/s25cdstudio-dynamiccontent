                <h3><span>A</span>Course Description</h3>
                <p>Building on top of the past learning in typography and interaction, students will learn practices of creating designs for dynamic content in this course. Interactive, print, or time-based projects will be made through collecting, organizing, and representing information. Computational methods of working with data will be discussed along with established visual structures to represent quantitative information, but the emphasis is put on the creative exploration of visual systems with data, logic, and user input.</p>

                <h3><span>B</span>Course Outline</h3>
                
                <p><b>Poster (Collect and Analyze) (Week 1-4)</b></p>
                <p>
                    Choose a regular activity or environment in your daily life that you want to observe. This could be your morning routine, the sounds in your neighborhood, the patterns of people in a public space, or the variations in your own habits. We will record these behaviors as quantitative or qualitative data, and later design a digital poster that shows your collected data by using symbols, typography, colour/texture, and hierarchy. Your visual design should reflect the visual material that you gather.
                </p>

                <p><b>Infographic(s), Diagram(s) (Structure and Storytelling) (Week 5-8)</b></p>
                
                <p>
                    Pick one dataset or more datasets you are interested in visualizing or curious about. We will learn to do data cleaning to better analyze and understand it. Take this data and make one or multiple graph(s), diagrams, or visualizations that show your findings or insights. What graphs most accurately represent your chosen dataset? What charts clearly communicate the findings and insights?
                </p>

                <p><b>Interactive Information (Computation and Logic) (Week 9-15)</b></p>
                <p>
                    In this assignment, we will create our own personal dataset and create an interactive visualization by leveraging computational methods. We will learn how to use p5.js to visualize data in code, and think about how the map function can help us invent our own charts: such as playing with color intensities, shape sizes reflecting quantities, mouse interaction, or animated transitions. Through hands-on coding experience, we will critically think about questions like: What are the limitations of using data viz softwares? Why do designers code? What's the benefit of coding our own chart?
